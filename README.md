# Password-Generator-Project-
This Python project is a straightforward yet effective password generator. 
To create secure and adaptable passwords, user input is required:

✅ Step 1: Request Password Components from the User
The application queries the user:

How many capital and lowercase letters are there?

How many symbols, such as @, #,!, etc., are there?

How many numbers, like 0–9, are there?

✅ Step 2:import random module and Use Python's random.choice() to Choose Characters at Random:

From predefined lists, it chooses the designated number of letters, symbols, and numbers at random.

A list named password_list contains these characters.

✅ Step 3: Use Shuffle to Increase Security
To eliminate any predictable patterns, the characters in password_list are shuffled using random.shuffle() in the hard version
(e.g., letters first, then symbols, then numbers).

✅ Step 4: Merge and Present the Password
The final secure password is printed after the shuffled list has been combined into a single string.

✅ Example of Output: 
Your password is: a&2F9!b7#
